# Welcome to the Google Earth Engine Batch Asset Manager docs!

Google Earth Engine Batch Asset Manager, *GEEBAM*, helps in management of assets on the [Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)

## What's Earth Engine?

*Google Earth Engine combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities and makes it available for scientists, researchers, and developers to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface.*

## Why GEEBAM?

Google Earth Engine is an amazing tool, but lacks one essential feature for some of the work we have been doing: ability to upload assets in batch mode. In one use case we were looking at biodiversity for thousands of terrestrial vertebrates. In order to compute forest loss, we had to upload first range maps of all species of interest - that's how GEEBAM was born.

If you're curious about our work, [Birdlife article](https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/news/forest-loss-century-driving-many-species-towards-extinction-warns-new-study) covers it nicely. More in-depth treatment can be found in our article [Toward quantification of the impact of 21st‚Äêcentury deforestation on the extinction risk of terrestrial vertebrates](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cobi.12715).
