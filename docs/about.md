## Why Google Earth Engine Batch Asset Manager?

Google Earth Engine is an amazing tool, but lacks one essential feature for some of the work we have been doing: ability to upload assets in batch mode. In one use case we were looking at biodiversity for thousands of terrestrial vertebrates. In order to compute forest loss, we had to upload first range maps of all species of interest - that's how GEEBAM was born.

Cheers!
